This was my first ride around Lake Merced.  I was surprised at how flat it was compared to what I remembered from riding the bus through this area.

Unfortunately, I'm still getting used to riding with the Edge 1000 and forgot to resume the ride after stopping to take a quick stop to take a picture.

I actually started this ride at the Chipotle on Sloat, but forgot to press start until I was on Lake Merced Blvd's bike path :(.

After making a lap around Lake Merced I decided I wanted to ride my normal route on the Great Highway bike path to Lincoln and back.

Overall, it was a great ride and I'm starting to feel progress getting back in shape.
