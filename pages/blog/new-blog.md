# Bye Tumblr (it's been a long road)

**03 March 2013**

So I’ve decided to give up on ol’ Tumblr. It has served me well for the years that I’ve used it but I just don’t do much blogging anymore.

I plan to use this space (and Github pages) to host a Jekyll generated site. I can easily write a post in Markdown and commit it and be done and not have to worry much about formatting.

Hopefully the ease of posting will encourage me to write more.
