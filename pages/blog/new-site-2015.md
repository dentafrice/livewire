# New Site

**January 2nd, 2015**

My old website used to be just a landing page with a separate blog hosted on Github pages using Jekyll.

Since they were separate websites they were getting a bit hard to maintain and it generally wasn't that fun to write a new blog post since I had to make sure Jekyll was working, figure out the commands and syntax for a new post, etc.

I got bored last night and decided to create a new site and port over my few blog entries.

It's a super simple script (albeit messy) that converts markdown to HTML with pandoc and recursively builds up a template for a page based on some goofy variables I made up.

There's no CSS or JS on the new site (except for a code highlighter that I can include on specific pages).

I wanted to go with minimal styling so that I never have to focus on that but instead can focus on the content.
